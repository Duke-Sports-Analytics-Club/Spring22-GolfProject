```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load-libraries}
library(tidyverse)
```

Load the data in using this command:
```{r read-data}
pgaData <- read_csv("data/tourneyLevelRawData2016-2022.csv")
```

This is a MASSIVE dataset, containing every PGA player's complete tournament data from 2016 (when Bryson entered the PGA tour) to 2022 (present). Let's filter for a few things to make it a little bit easier to navigate to the people we want to see.

```{r filter-only-bryson}
brysonTournamentResults <- pgaData %>%
  filter(Player_initial_last == "B. DeChambeau")

write_csv(brysonTournamentResults, "data/BrysonTournaments.csv")
```
