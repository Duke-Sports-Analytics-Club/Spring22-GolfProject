# Spring22-GolfProject
This project, performed in accordance with the Duke Sports Analytics Club, performs a case study on data from the PGA Tour in order to find what separates certain golfers from others. This project was performed by Brian Janger, Matthew Hawkins, Carson Blount, Max Rego, and Sam Fuller.

In particular, this project performs a case study on Bryson DeChambeau, a 28-year old professional who has won 8 tournaments on the PGA Tour. Over the COVID-19 pandemic, he has worked tirelessly to improve his driving distance since he deems it a very important part of the game. Currently, he ranks first in average driving distance and we want to see how much of an advantage DeChambeau truly gets from this improvement.

By comparing DeChambeau's tournament statistics (in areas including, but not limited to driving distance, dirivng accuracy, putting, scrambling percentage, and more), we want to see what the true strengths and weaknesses of his game are, and by comparing him to other golfers on the PGA Tour with other notable strengths (like Colin Morikawa's iron play), we want to see which area of the game it is most advantageous to be better than your opponents at.

This project was completed in the Spring 2022 semester at Duke University through the Duke Sports Analytics Club. Duke Sports Analytics Club claims all rights to this project, and the club may take credit for this project as long as the original authors are credited as well.
